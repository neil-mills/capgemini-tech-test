Capgemini Tech Test
==============================

To run the project
--------

Clone the repo, then cd into the project root directory.
npm install
npm run start

Notes
--------

In the 40 minutes timeframe i have managed to complete the full page build as well as create very simple javascript form validation functionality. If given more time to complete the project i would have worked on creating more advanced form validation, as well as continuing to check browser compatibility.

Thanks Neil.
